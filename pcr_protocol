# PCR Protocol - Genner Lab
### Jack A. Greenhalgh :: November 2021

### Consumables required

* PCR tubes
* PCR tube rack
* Mastermix (e.g. GoTaq Green)
* Primers 
* Diluted forward primer(s) - 2 nmol/L
* Diluted reverse primer(s) - 2 nmol/L
* Distilled water
* Agarose gel powder
* Gel red

### PCR steps 

1. Clean working surfaces with 70% ethanol, followed by 10% bleach, and then 70% ethanol solution. 
2. Load the required number of PCR tubes into a PCR tube rack (add an additional tube for a negative control).
3. Number each tube using a black marker pen on the sides and lids. 
4. Make a note of which number corresponds to which PCR tube in your lab book.

### Table 1. Reagents to be pipetted into each PCR tube for a 20 μl reaction
Reagent | Vol (μl) 
--- | ---
Mastermix | 10
Forward primer(s)| 2
Reverse primer(s)| 2
Water| 5
Template | 1

5. Pipette 10 μl of mastermix into each PCR tube.
6. Pipette 2 μl of foward primer into each PCR tube.
7. Pipette 2 μl of reverse primer into each PCR tube.
8. Pipette 5 μl of water into each PCR tube.
9. Pipette 1 μl of template into each PCR tube. 
10. Close the lids of all PCR tubes. 
11. Spin the PCR tubes in the spinner for a few seconds to allow all the reagents to fall to the bottom of each PCR tube. 
12. Load the PCR tubes into the PCR machine with the 'corner boys' in lab 241. The 'corner boys' are empty PCR tubes that prevent the tops of your sample PCR tubes being crushed/melted by the machine. 
13. Make sure that the PCR tubes are inserted into the small holes in the PCR machine and then close the PCR machine lid.
14. Programme the PCR machine with the desired denaturing, annealing and extension times and temperatures and the number of cycles required for your reaction. 
15. Save the programme and exit the set-up window. 
16. Press start and select MC (not left option)
