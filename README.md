# qPCR Protocol - Genner Lab
### Jack A. Greenhalgh :: November 2021

### Consumables required

* qPCR plate
* qPCR plate holder
* Mastermix (e.g. qPCR Biosystems)
* Probe
* Primers 
* Distilled water

### Step 1 - Preparing reagents 

1. Step 1 must be conducted in the eDNA extraction lab. 
2. Clean working surfaces with 70% ethanol, followed by 10% bleach, and then 70% ethanol solution. 
3. Remove your qPCR Biosystems mastermix, probe and primers from the freezer.
4. Add distilled water to your probe and primers as instructed on your order form to dilute the precipitates.
5. Once the water has been added, spin the probe and primers at 13,000 g for 1.5 mins to mix. 
6. Make a primer probe mix by combining your probe, primers and water in a 1.5 mL tube (Table 1). 

### Table 1. Reagents used to make 50 μl of primer probe mix
Reagent | Concentration (nmol/L) | Vol (μl) 
--- | --- | ---
Probe | 100 | 2
Forward primer | 100 | 4
Reverse primer | 100 | 4
Water | N/A | 40

7. Put the reagents that you're not using back in the freezer. 
8. Make a megamix by adding your mastermix, primer probe mix and distilled water (see Table 2). 

### Table 2. Reagents required for one reaction  
Reagent | Vol (μl) 
--- | ---
Mastermix | 2.5
Primer probe mix | 0.25
Distilled water | 1.25 

9. Take your megamix to the pre-PCR side of the main lab (131). 

### Step 2 - Loading the qPCR plate

10. Clean working surfaces three times with 70% ethanol, followed by 10% bleach, and then 70% ethanol solution. 
11. Take you sample(s) out of the freezer. 
12. Turn the qPCR machine on. 
13. Place a qPCR plate into a plate holder and turn the light on. 
14. Turn the plate upsidedown to prevent touching the same side of the well twice in the future.

### Table 3. Reagents to be pipetted into each qPCR well  
Reagent | Vol (μl) 
--- | ---
Megamix | 4
Distilled water | 1
Template | 1 

15. Add 4 μl of megamix to each qPCR well from right to left.
16. Gently tap the plate to cause the megamix to fall into the wells.
17. Reorientate the qPCR plate to the correct orientation. 
18. Add 1 μl of distilled water into each qPCR well from right to left. Push the water out of the pipette tip to form a bubble that can be placed on the side of each qPCR well. Make sure that you're successfuly pipetting 1 μl each time by visually checking the pipette tip. 
19. Add 1 μl of template into sample qPCR wells.
20. Add 1 μl of distilled water to negative control wells. 
21. Gently tap the plate to cause the megamix to fall into the wells.
22. Add a plastic seal (without cracks in it) to the top of the qPCR plate making sure that all the sides are tightly sealed by using the grey plastic tool.
23. Flick the qPCR plate to remove any bubbles that have formed in the bottom of the wells. Bubbles are OK at the top of the wells but not at the bottom.
24. Spin the qPCR plate in the spinner if bubbles persist. 

### Step 3 - Running the qPCR

25. Put the qPCR plate in the qPCR machine.
26. Open the laptop: Eco (not Eco Study) --> file --> open --> select eco.t files in the drop down list.  
27. Open EcoStudio and find EcoD file.  
28. Press run.
